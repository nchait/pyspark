this is a repository holding my recent work in PySpark as I go further in my Data Engineer career. I used a <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/spark-and-python-for-big-data-with-pyspark/">Udemy Course</a> to get started and it was great. i completed the short course and now i am creating some exciting ML projects surrounding Sports Predictions and NLP (seperately).
